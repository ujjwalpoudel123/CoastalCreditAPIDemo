 * Project: Coastal Credit Job Interview Mini Project
 * 
 * Description of the project : 
 * Create a single-page mobile-first web application that allows the user to control their credit card.  
 * The application will allow the user to lock/freeze their card to disable transactions or unlock/unfreeze it to enable transactions again.  
 * The current state of the card should be maintained within the “session”.  The user should get a confirmation that their submission was successful.  
 * The user should be able to submit messages or report an issue with their card (i.e. lost/damaged/stolen).  
 * If a card is reported lost/damaged/stolen then it should also be frozen.
 *
